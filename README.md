# SingleServeFriends

A mobile app and website to find someone to have lunch with. No dating, no hangups, just a friend for a meal.
App will be crowdsourced for content and written as a community.

Single Serve Friends is all about those days where you're feeling down or lonely. When your friends are "too
busy" to spend time with you. When all you are craving is some personal connection with anyone. Its a
universal fact that everyone has to eat and it goes without saying that going out to eat is always more
enjoyable than eating something at home. So we decided that we needed somewhere we could look to find someone
to go get a meal with us. This isn't about dating. It isn't about meeting someone new. Its all about having
some company and not feeling alone.

Single Serve Friends will utilize user profiles. All users must have a profile picture. In order to make this
an enjoyable experience, users will be weighted on the frequency of matches. Each user will have the ability
to "review" the other user on a short, private survey. The higher rated, more frequent users will be matched
and paired with relatively newer users. Conversation starters and topics will be available for users that are
need them, but are not required to be used.

Users will be able to fill out a small, short profile that describes their interests and eating preferences
(ie. talkative, quiet, etc.) We understand that not everyone wants to talk to the person they are having a
meal with, some just prefer the company and to share time with another person. Engine will match users based
on shared interests or estimated likelyhood of enjoying each others company, however it will not rely solely
on this metric and still allow for true random pairings even if it is expected them to hate each other. Users
can mark someone as either someone they would like to share a meal with again or to not be matched again as
part of their after meal survey.

Core Concepts of this App:
* All communication is encrypted at all times. Transmitted over SSL.
* User Profiles with meal preferences.
* Engine to match users with similar interests.
* After meal survey rating various characteristics. (Talkability, Manners, Etiquitte, Tipping, Conversation
Topics)
* Users are able to message one another.
* Meal and Location Reccommendations.
* Users can mark themselves as "Actively Looking" for an hour and increase likelyhood of coming up as a match.
* All Users are potential matches at all times (unless blocked) and the app brings up a small set of matches
for the User to pick from. They can also refresh their matches if they don't want to share a meal with any of
their matches.
